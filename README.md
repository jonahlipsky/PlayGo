* Project Title: PlayGo!
* Background and Overview
    * Motivation for project: One of the ancient strategy games of the world, Go has engrossed humans for millenia. PlayGo! will provide an easy-to-use interface for playing Go against a friend or a stranger. 
    * High level overview: The game Go uses relatively simple rules and a grid board which, together, create more than 10^170  [legal board positions](https://tromp.github.io/go/legal.html). It's an ancient strategy game with incredible layers of complexity. 
    
* Functionality and MVP Features
    * Feature 1: Game board and rule set
      * The full implementation of the game rules allow for game pieces to be captured and illegal moves to be refused with an error message. 
      * Illegal moves include: playing in a position that would result in being immediately taken and repeating a board position less than 1 full turn (both players playing) after it was previously seen.
      * Game board input allows for 9x9, 13x13 and 19x19 boards.
    * Feature 2: One-sided turn based clickable game interacting with the game board. 
       * Users on the same computer can play a game of Go by clicking on the game board at a certain position.
       * Stone will automatically be assigned to black or white depending on the turn
